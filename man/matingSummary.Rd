\title{Summarize a Mating Scene}
\usage{
matingSummary(scene, type = "auto", k = 1, compatMethod = "si_echinacea")
}
\arguments{
\item{scene}{a matingScene object}

\item{type}{character. whether to do a temporal (t), spatial (s), or mating
type (mt) summary. The default is "auto" which will automatically summarize
all mating information in scene}

\item{k}{integer. Which nearest neighbor to calculate (only for type == "s")}

\item{compatMethod}{character indicating the method to use when calculating
compatiblity. Defaults to "si_echinacea"}
}
\value{
a list or a list of lists containing summary information
including:\cr
temporal - year (year), population start date (popSt), mean individual start date
(meanSD), standard deviation of start (sdSD), mean duration (meanDur),
standard deviation of duration (sdDur), peakDay - day(s) on which highest
number of individuals were receptive (peak), mean end date (meanED),
standard deviation of end date (sdED), population end date (popEnd)\cr
spatial - minimum x (minX), minimum y (minY), maximum x (maxX),
maximum y (maxY), average distance to kth nearest neighbor as specified
by k (k<n> where n is the input for k)\cr
compatibility - number of mating types (nMatType), average number of
compatible mates (meanComp)\cr
If scene is a multi-year matingScene, then the output will be a list
of lists, one list for each year.

\description{
Create a summary of information contained within a matingScene object.
