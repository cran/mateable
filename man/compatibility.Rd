\title{Make potentials object--mating type compatibility}
\usage{
compatibility(scene, method, subject = "all", averageType = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{scene}{a matingScene object}

\item{method}{either "si_echinacea" or "dioecious" see details for
further description}

\item{subject}{whether you want pair, individual, population, or all.
Specifying more than one is allowed.}

\item{averageType}{whether to calculate individual and population proximity
using the mean or median}
}
\value{
A potentials object containing one more more of the following, depending the
input for \code{subject}: \cr
If \code{subject} is "population" the return list will contain a numeric
value that has a range depending on the \code{method}. If
\code{subject} is "pair" the return list will contain a matrix
with all pairwise compatibilities. If \code{subject} is "individual"
the return list will contain a dataframe with a column containing IDs and
a column containing compatibility averages. If \code{subject} is "all"
the return list will contain all three of the items above.
}
\description{
Calculate one or several of measures of mating compatibility.
}
\details{
When \code{method} is "si_echinacea" compatibility will be
calculated as self incompatible (si) in the same manner as Echinacea
(and many other plants). For two individuals, they are incompatible if
they share any S alleles (columns s1 and s2) and they compatible otherwise.
When \code{method} is "dioecious" it is assumed that the column s1 will
contain either a 1 or 2 depending on the individual's sex. Thus, when
comparing two individuals, they are compatible if s1 of the first != s1
of the second, and s2 is ignored.

pop <- simulateScene()
compatibility(pop, "si_echinacea")
