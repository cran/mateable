\title{Mating Receptivity by Day}
\usage{
receptivityByDay(scene, summary = FALSE, nameDate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scene}{a matingScene object}

\item{summary}{logical, summarizes number of receptive individuals on each day}

\item{nameDate}{logical, if summary = TRUE, option to name indices of the vector by the date they represent (rather than named relative to first day of receptivity in a season)}
}
\value{
if summary = FALSE (default), a matrix where the columns represent all mating days and the rows
represent all individuals in the population. If summary = TRUE, a named vector where each index gives the
number of receptive individuals on a given day and is named by the day it represents. If a matrix, the value at position
[i,j] will be TRUE if individual j was receptive on day i \cr
If scene is a multi-year matingScene, then receptivityByDay will return a list of matrices
(as described above) where each matrix represents one year.
}
\description{
Create a matrix showing which individuals are receptive on a given day.

\examples{
pop <- simulateScene(size = 10)
