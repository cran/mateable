\arguments{
\item{scene}{a matingScene object}
}

a matrix where the columns represent all mating days and the rows
represent all individuals in the population. The value at position
[i,j] will be TRUE if individual j was receptive on day i \cr
If scene is a multi-year matingScene, then overlap will return a list of matrices
(as described above) where each matrix represents one year.
}
